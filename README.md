Hi, I'm an Integrated Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin. I started learning to code in my first year of college coming from a love for maths and smaller engineering projects. I've been learning Java, C, and ARM assembly. I've recently been getting better with Python and DSA.

My repositories consist of a lot of projects and assignments, some of which weren't originally created on GitHub, so not all of them have consistent commits. A lot of these were used for learning new concepts and trying to understand computer science principles.
